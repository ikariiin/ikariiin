I make some projects, but my commits are very much not regular and pushes more so. I try to work on
web / full-stack stuff, w/ react and node.

I'm open to PRs on all of my public repos. So shoot one if you want to, and I'll be sure to review it!

Thanks for checking out.

Reach out to me on my email: gourabnag12 [at] gmail [dot] com
Or Discord: ikariiin

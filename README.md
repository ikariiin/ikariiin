I build stuff, but my commits are very much not regular, and PRs more so. I try to work on
web / full-stack stuff, mostly with React and Node. I've worked with PHP in the past, and
have recently picked up stuff like Go.

I'm open to PRs on all of my public repos. So shoot one if you want to, and I'll review it!

Thanks for checking out.
